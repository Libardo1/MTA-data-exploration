
#Advertising Optomization Model Proposal#

Attn. President of the MTA:

What if there were a way to optomize subway advertising revenue down to the minute with no work for the MTA? New Yorkers know when their subway station is going to be crowded, but sifting through all the available data is a real hassle. 
Adbros, Inc has developed an advertising model that we think would be of great interest to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.

###The Model###
The price for ad space changes as more people get on the platform - advertisers set up their account preferences on our website to be filtered out as 'bid price' grows
digital screens change as more people are entering (entire passenger flow predicted by history data - we won't miss exits)
Historically popular routes have more expensive ad space based on turnstile data
