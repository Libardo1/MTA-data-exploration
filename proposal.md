The price for ad space changes as more people get on the platform - advertisers set up their account preferences on our website to be filtered out as 'bid price' grows
digital screens change as more people are entering (entire passenger flow predicted by history data - we won't miss exits)
Historically popular routes have more expensive ad space based on turnstile data
bc ads are constantly changing there is a constant flow of cash to the MTA rather than one big purchase and running for weeks

####Low Hassel, Low Cost, Huge Rewards####
The initial cost of our model is the purchase and installation of our digital screens throughout the subway system. While the digital screens are initially more costly than print ads, they will more than pay for themselves within months based on the constant revenue of our model.
