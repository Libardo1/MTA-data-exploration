
#Advertising Optomization Model Proposal#

Attn. President of the MTA:

What if there were a way to optomize subway advertising revenue down to the minute with no work for the MTA? New Yorkers know when their subway station is going to be crowded, but sifting through all the available data is a real hassle. 
Adbros, Inc has developed an advertising model that we think would be of great interest to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.

###The Model###
####How it Works###
Traditional advertising models can't predict unusually popular times and they require active management. On the other hand, our digital screens are set up to change as often as the flow of passengers moves through each station - no constant installation required. Advertisers visit our internet portal www.getyradhere.com and select criteria from dropdown menus that informs the maximum amount they are willing to pay to run their ads. As passengers enter and exit the turnstiles, the price changes and the revenue increases dramatically. 

We are also able to predict the most popular routes during what time of the day. 

The price for ad space on our digital screens changes as more people arrive on the platform. Historically popular routes are  
The price for ad space changes as more people get on the platform - advertisers set up their account preferences on our website to be filtered out as 'bid price' grows
digital screens change as more people are entering (entire passenger flow predicted by history data - we won't miss exits)
Historically popular routes have more expensive ad space based on turnstile data
bc ads are constantly changing there is a constant flow of cash to the MTA rather than one big purchase and running for weeks

####Low Hassel, Low Cost, Huge Rewards####
The initial cost of our model is the purchase and installation of our digital screens throughout the subway system. While the digital screens are initially more costly than print ads, they will more than pay for themselves within months based on the constant revenue of our model.
