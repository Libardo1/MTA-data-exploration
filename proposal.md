
#Advertising Optomization Model Proposal#

Attn. President of the MTA:

What if there were a way to optomize subway advertising revenue down to the minute with no work for the MTA? New Yorkers know when their subway station is going to be crowded, but sifting through all the available data is a real hassle. 
Adbros, Inc has developed an advertising model that we think would be of great interest to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.

###The Model###
####How it Works###
Traditional advertising models can't predict unusually popular times and they require active management. On the other hand, our digital screens are set up to change as often as the flow of passengers moves through each station - no constant installation required. 

Advertisers visit our internet portal www.getyradhere.com and select criteria from dropdown menus that informs the maximum amount they are willing to pay to run their ads. As passengers enter and exit the turnstiles, the 'bid price' for each ad increases, and the revenue increases dramatically. 

Our model will respond as it is implimented. It is integrated with the social media to collect impressions and historic census data, so inappropraite ads will rarely appear.

####Low Hassel, Low Cost, Huge Rewards####
The initial cost of our model is the purchase and installation of our digital screens throughout the subway system. While the digital screens are initially more costly than print ads, they will more than pay for themselves within months based on the constant revenue of our model. 

##Conclusion##
It is clear that MTA advertising is both a huge opportunity and a huge hassle for the MTA. With hundreds of stations and lines, changing the ads and knowing the appropriate pricing for each ad is nearly impossible. Let the advertisers tell you how much they'll pay _you_, and let us do the heavy lifting while you reap the rewards of an optomized advertising model.
